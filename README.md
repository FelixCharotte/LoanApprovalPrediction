# Loan Approval Prediction: A Machine Learning Project  

## **PART 2 â€“ LOAN APPROVAL QUESTION**  

### **INTRODUCTION**  
This study aims to address two key questions:  
1. Which machine learning models can improve classification performance in predicting loan approvals?  
2. What factors significantly influence a bank's decision to approve or reject a loan application?  

The experiment leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance loan approval prediction accuracy. Initial analyses are performed using various decision-tree-based models. A stacked ensemble approach is later applied, combining LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost to achieve superior classification performance. A feature importance analysis was conducted to uncover the factors most critical to the decision-making process for loan approvals.  

This analysis offers actionable insights into financial credit evaluations, potentially improving both predictive models and the bank's decision-making framework.

### **RAW DATA**  
The following three datasets were used in this study:  
1. **train.csv**  
2. **test.csv**  
3. **credit_risk_dataset.csv**  

The **credit_risk_dataset.csv** serves as the original dataset, while the **train.csv** and **test.csv** were preprocessed versions created by the contest organizer. These preprocessed files feature identical characteristics to the original dataset. To maximize data usage and enhance prediction accuracy, we merged **credit_risk_dataset.csv** with **train.csv**.

### **PROCESS**  

#### **1. Data Exploration**  
- Dataset size: **91,226 entries** with 12 features.  
- Features with missing values: **person_emp_length** and **loan_int_rate**.  
- Observations: Most features have **right-skewed distributions**, such as **person_income**, suggesting a presence of outliers. Others, like **loan_int_rate**, show near-normal distributions.  

Key categorical observations:  
| **Feature**             | **Key Observation**                                       |  
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Home Ownership**       | Majority (47,040 records) are renters.                   |  
| **Loan Intent**          | Education is the most common loan purpose (18,724 records). |  
| **Loan Grade**           | Grade A dominates, indicating high applicant creditworthiness. |  
| **Default Status**       | Majority (76,779) have no default history (good creditworthiness). |  

These insights shaped further preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling steps.

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Encoding categorical variables**: Transformed object-type features using `LabelEncoding`.  
- **Outlier handling**: Addressed extreme values with IQR-based truncation to improve data quality.  
- **Missing value imputation**: Used **KNNImputer** to accurately fill missing values for continuous variables.

#### **3. Feature Engineering**  
Created 36 new features by deriving information from seven perspectives critical to loan approval decisions:  

| **Category**                 | **Example Features Created**                         |  
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Income**                   | Income-to-loan ratio, logarithmic transformation.   |  
| **Loan History**             | Historical loan frequency, new borrower flag.       |  
| **Reputation Score**         | Loan-to-history ratio, grade-to-history relationships. |  
| **Guarantees & Mortgages**   | Loan amount vs. house value.                        |  
| **Repayment Capacity**       | Loan amount vs. employment duration.                |  
| **Loan Reasonableness**      | Income mismatches (e.g., high income but renting).  |  
| **Interest Rate Risk**       | Deviation from average interest rate, rate-history ratio. |

#### **4. Model Training and Evaluation**  
Baseline models evaluated:  
| **Model**                 | **Accuracy** | **ROC Score** | **Training Time (s)** |
